Getting Started with the Project
----------------------------------

To run the project, follow these steps:

Build and run the Docker containers using docker-compose.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

Docker will now pull the necessary images, build the backend and frontend containers, and start the application.

**Accessing the Backend**:

Once the containers are up and running, the backend server will be accessible at:

```bash
http://0.0.0.0:8000/
```
